I made this to send me alerts of when ether goes up/down 6% or more, you'll have to update the email/password/phone number for your own credentials 

This checks every hour from when starting the application


Version 1.1:
    >Fixed login timeout issue 
    >changed threshold from 10% to 6%
    >fixed math
